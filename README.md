# AI-chatbot
🤖 AI Chatbot using Python
In this project, we build a simple text-based AI chatbot using Python. The chatbot responds to various user inputs using a predefined set of responses loaded from a response.json file. It can also answer questions about the current date and time and logs all interactions into a chat history file.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
Python 3

IDE: Visual Studio Code / any Python IDE

Libraries:

json – to read predefined chatbot responses

datetime – to show real-time date and time

🚀 Project Workflow
Load Predefined Responses
The chatbot loads replies from a response.json file.

Start User Interaction
The chatbot accepts user input in the terminal and processes it using conditional logic.

Generate Replies
Based on the input, it:

Replies using JSON responses

Shows current date/time using datetime

Responds politely to greetings and farewells

Log Chat History
Every input and response is saved with a timestamp to a file called ChatHistory.txt.

🧠 Supported Inputs
The chatbot can respond to:

Greetings: hi, hello

Exit commands: bye, exit, quit

Date/time queries: what is the time, what is the date

Common phrases: how are you, who created you, tell me a joke, etc.

✅ Results
The chatbot responds in real time and saves full conversation logs.
This demonstrates a basic implementation of an AI-like interaction using logic-based rules.
